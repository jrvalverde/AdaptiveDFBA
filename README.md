# AdaptiveDFBA
An implementation of the AdaptiveDFBA algorithm using R and the sybil package

A more complete description will be added after the paper has been published.

For now, suffice it to say that, here, you will find an expanded DFBA method,
that allows for greater versatility in controlling/steering dynamic FBA 
metabolic simulations.

You will also find here data and an example driver script that can be used as
a command line program to simplify adpative dynamic FBA calculations in most
cases.
