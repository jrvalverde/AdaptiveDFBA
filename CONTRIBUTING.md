If you have issues with this code, please do contact the author.

If there is functionality that you would like to see added, there are two options

a) you can contact us and let us now: we will do our best to add this functionality
   as soon as possible
   
b) you can add it yourself and let us know so we can include your additions to the
   source (and acknowledge properly your contribution)
   
Please, do note that there is no guarantee that we will include any modifications
that we receive. When we do receive any suggestion for modifications we will

1) inspect the code submitted for clarity and quality

2) include it on a local copy and test it exhaustively

3) if the code does indeed provide useful features and not clutter, works
   correctly, and abides by the rules set forth here, then it will be added.
   
That means that it will take some time to test your modifications. You can help us
by writing and including test code with your modifications so that it is easier to
verify how it works.
   
This code has been created under public grants, and hence all code should remain
publicly usable, so, if you want to contribute, you should bear this in mind. The 
code is released under GNU GPL/EU GPL, and your contributions should be released 
equally to be included.

Get back to this file periodically to see updates to these rules. We will be updating
them as the project grows.
