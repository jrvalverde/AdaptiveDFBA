\description{
\code{banner()} prints out a text in large letters much like UNIX banner
but does not truncate text at 10 characters. Instead, it will print
all the text given in a single "line".
}
\details{
Since output letters are 8 characters wide, this means, in fact, that
if you want your text to look good, you should truncate it to the
line width limit selected in your R session divided by 8.

Maybe in a future release I will modify the package to detect maximum
line width and do the truncation... for now I find it more useful not
to have explicit limits.
